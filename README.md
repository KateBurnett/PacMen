# PacMen
## MIT PacMen Coding Exercise
<br>
Description: Our task in this activity was to create a randomly positioned PacMan by clicking the "Add PacMan" button and have the PacMen move across the page at random velocities. We were also required to code a boundary for the PacMen to bounce off of and change the image to match directional movement to make the PacMen "turn around" when they hit the page edge.
<br>
How to Run: Click "Add PacMan" too create a new PacMan at any time. Click "Start Game" to start the PacMen moving around the defined area.
<br>
Future improvements: Future iterations could add randomized color to each PacMen.
